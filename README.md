# Travelth
TRAVELTH!- Project is mainly to help the travelers with unexpected weather calamities. Our application collects the travelling and medical details of the travelers. According to the location given we will send the climatic facts of that place and also tell them about their health problems associated with the climate of the place they are visiting, during their visit we will provide the live weather updates to the users. We will get the location coordinates of the person who uses our application.   If weather is predicted unfair during their visit we immediately notify them about their safety and the location of the user is monitored. If they lost their way or lost somewhere we make use of the location coordinates which fetched from the user and share the location and health details of the user with the rescue team and help them get rescued. If fetching location of the user gets affected we share the last checked in location of the user with rescue team and help them to get rescued. 
In every disaster that has been happened till now many lives have gone because the victims are lost or unlocated by the rescue team. 
Our project's motive is to prevent damage or death to the lost victim.
